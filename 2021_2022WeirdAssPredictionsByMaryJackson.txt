1)Boris Johnson will have to resign by ascention day, 2022

2)Someone from Q set up Alec Baldwin, and it's going to be some kind of bonkers conspiracy to get revenge on him for playing D*na*d T***p on SNL

3)Mr. Biden will not run for a second term, he will skip over his VP and give it to Pete B, reataining her as VP. (which would be a tragedy, but I'm just predicting it)
